    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the
      wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions
      in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
        sausage and lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored
        with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
        out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h3>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      lasagna:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
      <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
      <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
        heat until well browned.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
        with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½
        hours, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna
        noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse
        with cold water.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2
        tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
        baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping
        slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of
        the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
        and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking
        spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
